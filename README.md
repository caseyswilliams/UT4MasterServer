# UT4MasterServer

This is a reimplementation of EpicGames servers, just enough to be able to serve as a master server for Unreal Tournament pre-alpha. There is still lots to do. Anyone is welcome to help out. Reach us on [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/2DaCWkK).

## Contribution

There is not much documentation on how to get started. I will create issues that need resolving as time goes on, but there are also a bunch of `// TODO` comments which tell what is still missing.

### Required packages for running with Visual Studio 2022

- .NET desktop development
- Container development tools

### Running & debugging with Visual Studio 2022

1. Install Docker
2. Install Visual Studio 2022
3. Open `UT4MasterServer.sln` with Visual Studio 2022
4. Set `docker-compose` as the Startup Project
5. Start Debugging

### Running without Visual Studio 2022

To run in development mode use `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up -d` inside repository's root.

## FAQ for users and hub/server owners

### How to make UT4 connect to new master server?

1. Use `Files/Engine.ini` in this repository as a template
2. Replace all occurrences of `<PUT_MASTER_SERVER_DOMAIN_HERE>` with the domain of master server you want to connect to
3. Copy the content and append all of it to your local `Engine.ini` file
    - Windows path: `C:\Users\<your_username>\Documents\UnrealTournament\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor`
    - Linux path: `/home/<your_username>/UnrealTournament/Saved/Config/LinuxNoEditor`

### How to make UT4 hubs and servers connect to new master server?

Follow steps 1 through 3 from section `How to make UT4 connect to new master server?` but instead append to `Engine.ini` located in server's directory.

- Windows Server Path: `<install_location>\UnrealTournament\Saved\Config\WindowsServer`
- Linux Server Path: `<install_location>/UnrealTournament/Saved/Config/LinuxServer`

### How to register new account?

Use `POST account/api/create/account` endpoint with body parameters `username=<username>&password=<password>`.

### How to log in to your account inside the game?

You have 2 options. There is an easy way which is less secure and harder way which is more secure.

1. Easy way **(generally recommended)**
    1. Add `UnrealTournament` parameter to your UT4 shortcut:
    Example:

    ```text
    "D:\Epic Games\UnrealTournament\Engine\Binaries\Win64\UE4-Win64-Shipping.exe" UnrealTournament
    ```

    2. After starting game, you should see login window. Enter your credentials and you should be able to play.
2. Hard way
    1. Get `access_token` from `POST account/api/oauth/token` with `grant_type: password`
    2. `GET account/api/oauth/exchange` with Bearer authorization (`access_token` from `POST account/api/oauth/token`)
    3. Add parameters to your UT4 shortcut and replace `your_password_code` with `code` from `GET account/api/oauth/exchange`:

    ```text
    "D:\Epic Games\UnrealTournament\Engine\Binaries\Win64\UE4-Win64-Shipping.exe" UnrealTournament -AUTH_LOGIN=unused -AUTH_PASSWORD=your_password_code -AUTH_TYPE=exchangecode
    ```

    NOTE: You need to repeat point *b* and *c* if you want to login again.

### How to track statistics on new master server?

It is not possible to do this without editing the client. UT4UU will try to address this in the future.

### I really don't want to use UT4UU, but I want master server to track my statistics

A workaround would be for the admin of master server to issue you a self-signed certificate. You can then install this certificate so that it is trusted by your machine. Finally, you can add an entry into your `hosts` file and redirect `datarouter.ol.epicgames.com` to master server's domain.
